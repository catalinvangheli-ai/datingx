# DatingX

DatingX is a dating application focused on compatibility rather than superficial matching.
The goal is to help users find meaningful connections based on lifestyle, values, personality, and relationship intentions.

## Concept

Most dating apps rely primarily on photos and quick swipes.
DatingX takes a different approach by building user profiles that clearly describe who a person is and what they are looking for.

Matching is based on:
- lifestyle compatibility
- personal values
- emotional availability
- relationship goals

## Core Features (planned)

- Detailed user profiles with structured fields
- Compatibility-based matching (not swipe-only)
- Clear relationship intentions
- Advanced search and filtering
- Privacy-focused profile visibility
- Reporting and moderation tools

## Target Audience

- Adults (18+)
- Users interested in meaningful connections
- People who value clarity and compatibility over appearance-only matching

## Tech Stack (initial idea)

- Frontend: (to be decided)
- Backend: (to be decided)
- Database: (to be decided)
- Authentication: (to be decided)

## Project Status

This project is in early development.
The structure, data models, and core logic are being defined.

## Goals

- Reduce mismatched connections
- Encourage honest and complete profiles
- Improve the quality of matches, not the quantity

## License
